# ConnectFour

[**Click Here**](https://virginiawu11.github.io/ConnectFour/) to start the Connect Four game!

Two players, 1 (red) and 2 (blue) players alternate turns, dropping a piece of their color from the top of a column. The piece will fall down to the unoccupied slot.

The game is won when a player makes four in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The game is a tie if the entire board fills up without a winner.
